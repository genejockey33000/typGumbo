\title{Correlate vector to matrix and test significance}
\usage{
CorVMatSig(x, y, method = "pearson", iter = 100, p.cutoff = 0.05, pct = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Named Vector to be correlated with matrix y}

\item{y}{Matrix with compatible names as vector x}

\item{method}{type of correlation to use "pearson" or "spearman"}

\item{iter}{number of iterations to run}

\item{p.cutoff}{p value cutoff for determining significance}

\item{pct}{percentage upper variance to use}
}
\description{
Correlate Named Vector to similarly named columns in a  matrix and determine probability of seeing
that number of significant correlations relative to a NULL distribution. Input vector (x)
 is a named vector that corresponds to colnames in matrix (y). Correlations between
